# gradiant-descent
This function takes 5 parameters:

1. starting point - in our case, we define it manually but in practice, it is often a random initialisation

2. gradient function - has to be specified before-hand

3. learning rate - scaling factor for step sizes

4. maximum number of iterations

5. tolerance to conditionally stop t
